      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, we take a break from discussions and run a one-day hackathon.
Hackathons typically explore new technologies or even create new product
prototypes. Past hackathons have ranged from hardware projects to the
exploration of new languages, and some have focused on a particular product or
technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a group that wants to explore a topic. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably start forming
groups on Monday and Tuesday, as you discover other people&amp;rsquo;s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons take place in either the conference venue or the various houses
that are rented by groups in town. The evening of the hackathon, results are
presented in the &lt;em&gt;Hackathon Showcase Lightning Talks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
