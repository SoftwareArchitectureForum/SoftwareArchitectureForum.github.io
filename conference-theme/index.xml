&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-design-thinking&#34;&gt;Applying Design Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Topics:&lt;/strong&gt;
-   Using new tools to solve old problems
-   Designing for simplicity: understandable is maintainable
-   Reconsidering agile timeboxing
-   Exploring the potential of cross-language development
-   Breaking out of our mental and cultural chains
-   Can we take the interview out of the job interview?
-   Re-envisioning how we recruit, onboard, and build teams
-   And lots more
-   Plus anything else anyone wants to talk about, of course
-   And our business track&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
preclude session topics that might be considered &amp;ldquo;off theme.&amp;rdquo; The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-hackathon&#34;&gt;Wednesday Hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons typically explore new technologies or even create new product
prototypes. Past hackathons have ranged from hardware projects to the
exploration of new languages, and some have focused on a particular product or
technology. All you need is a group that wants to explore a topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons take place in either the conference venue or the various houses
that are rented by groups in town. The evening of the hackathon, results are
presented in the &lt;em&gt;Hackathon Showcase Lightning Talks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
